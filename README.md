# churnmodelling-and-prediction-using-ANN
this churn modelling prediction is based on artificial neural networks and this model is trained with the datasets corresponding to a bank database which contains the details of all the customers from past six months and after the model is trained it can predict whether the customer will leave the bank or not! in this model i have used two hidden layers, one output layer and one input layer,the activation functions are Relu for hidden layers and sigmoid function for output layers. 

stoichastric gradient (adam) is used for backward propogation
